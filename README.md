# 911 Data Capstone Project
### 911 data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania analyzed and visualized.
### Range: Timestamp('2015-12-10 17:40:00') - Timestamp('2016-08-24 11:17:02')
#### This was a 'Capstone Project' from the Udemy course: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). 
### Methods:
 - Python 3 (Pandas, Numpy)
 - Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly/Cufflinks)
 
 ## Questions/Analysis:
